# About
Nebulo is a free, open-source, no-root, light-weight dns-over-https, dns-over-tls, and dns-over-http-over-quic client for Android with emphasis on privacy and security. Nebulo is fast, highly-customizable, ad-free, efficient on the battery, contains zero analytics / tracking. Goto [installation](#installation) and set it up on your Android device.

# My mission
My mission is to provide access to dns-over-tls and dns-over-https as a tool against censorship and tracking. Many countries block controversial or government-critical websites using DNS which can possibly be circumvented using either of those protocols.

The second topic, tracking, is nearly as important as the topic of censorship. Many ISPs use their own DNS servers as a way of tracking their users. Using DoH/DoT puts an end to this by encrypting the vulnerable DNS queries.

# How it works
Nebulo uses the VPN API of the Android system to create a dummy VPN which intercepts all packets for the dns servers of your device. This dummy VPN is __not__ a real VPN and does not tunnel your packets - it only handles dns packets. As only one VPN can be activate at any given time you have to decice between using Nebulo or a real VPN.

## Non-VPN mode
Look for it in the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## What this is based on
Nebulo is a completely original piece of software. It doesn't use any other dependency under the hood for the dns capabilities. Check the [dependencies](https://git.frostnerd.com/PublicAndroidApps/smokescreen/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L100) to see what is used for everything build around DoH/DoT.

## Incompatibilities, compatibilities, and possible problems 
- No other VPN can be active when Nebulo is running (at least when not running in Non-VPN mode mentioned above).
- Nebulo works fine with non-VPN firewalls in place (such as AFWall+), but changes in firewall profiles [could break the VPN](https://git.frostnerd.com/PublicAndroidApps/smokescreen/issues/84), requiring a restart of Nebulo.
- Other means of ad-blocking, like modifying the `/etc/hosts` file manually or using the AdAway app works alongside Nebulo just fine; though, the AdGuard app doesn't (that is, Nebulo does not receive any DNS queries when AdGuard's running).

## Core features
 * Encrypted DNS using dns-over-https, dns-over-tls, and dns-over-http-over-quic protocols.
 * Customizable in-memory DNS cache with configurable cache-expiry.
 * Preset list of privacy-respecting DNS servers.
 * Add any DNS server.
 * DNS speed test.
 * DNS query logging.
 * DNS blocklists.
    * Blocklist rules can be imported from remote URLs or on-device files (supports 4 different formats).
    * Blocks domains with _unspecified IPs_, `0.0.0.0` and `::0000`.
    * Automagically protects from [CNAME cloaking](https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/).
 * Advanced settings:
    * Disable IPv4 / IPv6.
    * Allow captive portals.
    * Allow search domains on the current network.
    * ... and more.

<br>
Please be aware that I'm not going to tolerate exact copies of this app on the Play Store. This project took a lot of work, not only from me, but many alpha/beta testers and translators. Copying is - per the license - generally allowed, but uploading a nearly identical version to the Play Store would be impersonation as per Google policy.

# Cloning
Feel free to clone this repository. However, there are a few things to consider:
- Nebulo uses some of my own libraries. Those are FOSS as well, you can find the URLs in the `build.gradle`.
   - These libraries are distributed as pre-built binaries using an Nexus3 server. Public credentials are contained in the root `build.gradle`
   - Alternatively, replace the dependencies (`implementation 'com.frostnerd.utilskt:....`) with git sub-modules (`implementation project(...)`) after cloning the libraries.
- Nebulo uses icons from Font Awesome covered under their free license with attribution.
