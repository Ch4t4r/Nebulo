  "main": "When navigating to a website known by it's name, say example.com, your device ask specific servers - DNS servers - how to address the website. DNS is an old protocol which, except for smaller changes, hasn't been touched since its creation in 1987. Naturally the Internet changed a lot in this time, rendering the protocol outdated in some of its core aspects.\n\nThis app tackles one of the bigger problems with DNS: Encryption.\nWhilst nearly all traffic on the Internet is encrypted now, DNS requests (i.e. questions for a names address) and the response aren't. This enables attackers to intercept, read and modify your requests.\n\nNebulo is a DNS changer which implements DNS-over-HTTPs and DNS-over-TLS to safely send your DNS requests to the target server. This way only you and the DNS server are able to read the requests you are sending.\n\nCore features:\n - Configure the app once and then forget about it. After initial configuration it works fully autonomous\n - No ads and no tracking\n - Custom servers can be used\n - Low battery consumption",

  "changelog_1.3.0-Beta": "A lot has changed since the last update!\n\n➤ There are now new translations\n➤ Battery usage has been reduced a bit\n➤ Nebulo now detects the type of new DoH servers\n➤ ... And more\n\nAnd as always, a few bugs have been fixed."
