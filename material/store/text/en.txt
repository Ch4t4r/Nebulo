When navigating to a website known by it's name, say example.com, your device ask specific servers - DNS servers - how to address the website. DNS is an old protocol which, except for smaller changes, hasn't been touched since its creation in 1987. Naturally the Internet changed a lot in this time, rendering the protocol outdated in some of its core aspects.

This app tackles one of the bigger problems with DNS: Encryption.
Whilst nearly all traffic on the Internet is encrypted now, DNS requests (i.e. questions for a names address) and the response aren't. This enables attackers to intercept, read and modify your requests.

Nebulo is a DNS changer which implements DNS-over-HTTPs and DNS-over-TLS to safely send your DNS requests to the target server. This way only you and the DNS server are able to read the requests you are sending.

Core features:
 - Configure the app once and then forget about it. After initial configuration it works fully autonomous
 - No ads and no tracking
 - Custom servers can be used
 - Low battery consumption
